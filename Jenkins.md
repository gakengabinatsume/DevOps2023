# Jenkins
**Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes in software development. It allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their applications, making the development process more efficient and reliable. Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins and integrations, enabling it to work with various tools and technologies. It is highly customizable and can be configured to meet specific project requirements.**
